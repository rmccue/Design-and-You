Design, and You!
================

Rationale
---------
Design, and You! is the result of my IT assignment for 2009. We were tasked
with creating a site from scratch using HTML. Using my prior knowledge of HTML,
and my knowledge of PHP, I have constructed this site from scratch.

Use
---
Although I doubt it, it's possible that someone will find this code useful,
I have put my code up on GitHub just in case. If you see any problems with it,
or wish to produce content for the site, please feel free to fork it and send
me a pull request afterwards.

If you do use the code, I'd love to know where you've used it. Watching code
spread around the internet is awesome. Feel free to send me a message through
GitHub.
